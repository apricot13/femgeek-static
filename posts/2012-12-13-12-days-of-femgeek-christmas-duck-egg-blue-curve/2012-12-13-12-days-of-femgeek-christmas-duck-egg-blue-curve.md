Are you all set for day 1 or 12.. of the 12 days of femgeek christmas!?

 

I thought it was about time I shared some freebies on this blog. I wasn’t really sure what to give away to you guys because my blog is a little all over the place but I hope i’ve covered all my bases.

 

When you use any of the freebies I’d really appreciate a link back to [femgeek.co.uk](http://www.femgeek.co.uk/). If you would like to, you can also follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/apricot_13). You can also add femgeek on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/femgeek.co.uk) and [google+ pages](https://plus.google.com/110396807693668334198/posts).

 

It would be great if you could tweet/facebook/google plus about the 12 days too!
