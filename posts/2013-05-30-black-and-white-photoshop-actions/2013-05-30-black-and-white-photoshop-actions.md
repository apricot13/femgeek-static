Iâ€™ve been using these actions for a while but I never released them as part of the [femgeek 12 days of christmas](http://www.femgeek.co.uk/tag/12-days-of-femgeek-christmas/)! (too many freebies!) Two black and white actions for your photos. One gives a high contrast black and white image, the other works best on low key photographs and produces a black and white image with a soft violet hue.
